# Cockroach ü™≥

This project was created as part of a course exploring **AI-driven interactive installations**.  
Using a **live camera feed** that detected the positions of visitors‚Äô feet on the floor (x,y coordinates), we coded a **Processing sketch** that simulated the behavior of cockroaches: scattering, running, and escaping in response to movement.

The result was a reactive visual system where digital cockroaches ‚Äúlived‚Äù in the installation space, creating a playful and slightly unsettling encounter between audience and algorithm.

## üé• Concept

Cockroaches are creatures that thrive in the periphery, scurrying away when humans appear.  
We translated this behavior into a **generative installation**:

- Visitors walking in the space acted as **disturbances**.  
- Their presence, tracked via x,y coordinates from a camera, pushed cockroaches away.  
- The simulation became a **living surface** where human movement dictated insect behavior.  

The work highlights the uncanny link between organic behavior, human presence, and algorithmic simulation.
